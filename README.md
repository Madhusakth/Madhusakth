### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 5th year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer engineering department at The University of Texas at Austin. I am advised by Prof. Ahmed Tewfik. My research interests are in the field of signal processing and machine learning. I work on developing efficient deep learning models for signal/image processing applications such as speech recognition and object detection.
