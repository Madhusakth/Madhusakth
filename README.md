### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I currently hold the position of Senior Video Research Engineer at Qualcomm, where I focus on developing deep learning models to estimate depth and optical flow for autonomous driving applications.

Prior to this role, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. Under the guidance of Prof. Ahmed Tewfik, my doctoral research was centered around developing novel algorithms for efficient radar data acquisition for automotive scenarios and deep learning model compression.
